        </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Make a roux by whisking the oil and flour together in a large, 
            heavy saucepan over medium-low heat to form a smooth mixture. 
            Cook the roux, whisking constantly, 
            until it turns a rich mahogany brown color. 
            This can take 20 to 30 minutes; watch heat carefully and whisk constantly or roux will burn. 
            Remove from heat; continue whisking until mixture stops cooking.</li>
            <li>Place the onion, green bell pepper, celery, and garlic into the work bowl of a food processor, 
                and pulse until the vegetables are very finely chopped. 
                Stir the vegetables into the roux, and mix in the sausage. 
                Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, and cook until vegetables are tender, 
                10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat, and set aside.</li>
                <li>Brown the sausage. Spread the sausage in a single layer on a hot, large skillet. Once browned, flip your sausages over to
                    make sure they are browned on both sides. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Add to a large pot. Add the water and beef bouillon cubes to the pot with the roux and vegetables. 
                        Bring to a boil, and simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. 
                        Skim off any foam that floats to the top during cooking. 
                        Stir in the salt, hot pepper sauce, Cajun seasoning, cayenne pepper, and file powder. 
                        Mix in the sausage, and simmer for 2 more hours. 
                        Skim off foam as needed. Remove from heat, and stir in the parsley. 
                        Serve over hot cooked rice.</li>
